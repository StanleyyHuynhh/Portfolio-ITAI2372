# Smart AR Helmet System for Astronauts

## Overview
The Smart AR Helmet System is designed to enhance astronaut safety, efficiency, and situational awareness during extravehicular activities (EVAs). This system integrates AI-powered augmented reality (AR) technology into an astronaut's helmet to provide real-time health monitoring, task assistance, and navigational support.

## Features
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health metrics, including heart rate, oxygen levels, and respiratory rate.
- **Task Assistance**: Step-by-step task guidance displayed directly on the helmet's HUD.
- **Navigation Assistance**: AR-guided navigation to help astronauts during EVAs.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Immediate notifications for critical health or safety issues.
