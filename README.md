# Smart AR Helmet System for Astronauts

## Project Overview
This Jupyter notebook simulates the Smart AR Helmet System designed to enhance astronaut safety and efficiency during EVAs (extravehicular activities). It integrates augmented reality (AR) with AI for real-time health monitoring, task assistance, and navigation.

### Features:
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health metrics such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and respiratory rate.
- **Task Assistance**: AR-guided step-by-step instructions during tasks.
- **Emergency Alerts**: Immediate notifications for critical health or safety issues.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-ar-helmet.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open `SmartARHelmet.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Run each cell to simulate the AR helmet functionality.
